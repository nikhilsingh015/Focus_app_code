# Focus_app_code

Application URL - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thelazynick.focus

Note: The application is built for both Android as well as IOS devices; however, I have only purchased the Developer license for playstore and hence it is published only on playstore.

Description:

An application with various natural sounds which are played in a loop for an interval of time, to help you Concentrate, Feel Relaxed, A better sleep and to Meditate.
